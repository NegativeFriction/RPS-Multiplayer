Firebase will store:


- player list
	- GUIDs

- Connections
	[GUID: {player:
		ID: GUID,
		name:,
		threw:,
		turn#:,
		win#}, {Player2 Obj},{player3 Obj}...

- Player who disonnected
	- (update on disconnect. Clear once it's iterated through all connections to update lobby positions)


psudocode:
say p1 disconnects

everyone just disconnects at once.
Then wait for your player ID in seconds
and then reconnect and get your new player ID as num children in connections

Wipe threw variable for both players while they select RPorS. Time to resolve when it isn't null && I'm P1 or P2

if I threw && P2 didn't throw-> store "P1 throw local"
If P2 threw && I threw -> Store P2 local
Go ahead and wipe database
calculate winner and loser locally
